# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

System/website developed with React + Vite using features such as:
  - React router
  - Hooks
  - HTTP requests
  - API
  - Context API

  Back-end - Firebase:
  - Authentication

Ps: Being developed yet. Only desktop version available yet...
